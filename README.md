## Issues (and fixes):
I am kind of fed up with this project at the moment and there are some stuff that needs fixing but I don't have the time to deal with.    

· For some reason it only works on python 3.10.    
· The program fails to set the statues to offline unless follow the instructions in the comment under setStatusOffline function.    
· Bans don't work for the same reason as above    
· There lorem ipsum in obline users (didn't have anything to replace it with..)
